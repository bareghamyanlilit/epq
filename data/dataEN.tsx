      "Ejmiatsin Vardges Hamazaspyan State College (formerly Ejmiatsin Club-Library Technical School) began its activities in 1969, by order No. C 188 of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of the Armenian SSR dated 13.08.1969. In the 1975-76 academic year, the technical school moved to a more spacious and comfortable building, and the 'Organization of Folk Instrument Amateur Groups' major was added to the list of specialties. Famous musicians of the republic began teaching here - Khachik Khachatryan, Hrant Torosyan, Hasmik Kanayan, Hambardzum Kachachyan, Mihran Demirchyan, and others. In 1992, through the efforts of the technical school's administration, a branch of the college was opened in Artsakh, and specialist teachers were sent there to organize methodological assistance. In 1994, cultural institutions collaborated in international organization programs, presenting 'Teaching Armenian Language', 'Teaching Russian Language', and 'Teaching English Language' programs. In 2000, by order No. 27 of the Ministry of Education and Science of the RA dated 13.12.1999, the technical school of the Chair of State Language of the National Assembly was renamed the Chair of State Language of the National Assembly. On May 29, 2007, the Vardan Ajemian Chair of Screen Arts was founded, which united the departments of screen arts, music, and drawing, and that same year, educational programs and student exchange programs were created for international cooperation. In the 2008-2009 academic year, a new institutional standard was approved, the foundation for the 9th institute program was created, which secured the continuous development of educational programs and research work of cultural institutions. In 2018, the activity of the base chair became the foundation for scientific educational programs related to screen arts. Videos, musical works, book publications, and new institutional programs were created that met the 21st-century educational standards. All this contributed to increasing the effectiveness of scientific work, and the institution also became an active participant in international programs.",
